conway-game-of-life
===================



After attending a Code Retreat last weekend here in Denver, I came away
knowing how to write tight Python code for Conway.  So here it is.  I also
have been experimenting with the javascript d3js library and this was a
perfect demo project.  I am not a javascript guru so the javascript is
less than perfect but the d3 demo is fun.
