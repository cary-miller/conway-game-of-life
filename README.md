conway-game-of-life
===================



After attending a Code Retreat last weekend here in Denver, I
came away knowing how to write tight Python code for Conway.  So
that is here.  I also have been experimenting with the
javascript d3js library and this was a perfect demo project for
that.  I am not a javascript guru so the javascript is less than
perfect but the d3 demo is fun.
